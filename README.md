# Data_Science_London_Kaggle

This is my implementation for the Data Science London competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-london-scikit-learn)

## Overview

Data Science London is hosting a meetup on Scikit-learn.  This competition is a practice ground for trying, sharing, and creating examples of sklearn's classification abilities (if this turns in to something useful, we can follow it up with regression, or more complex classification problems).

We encourage participants to post code via the "Tutorials" link on the left.  Don't worry about accuracy or whether your code is perfect.  The aim here is to explore sklearn by using it. You do not need to use sklearn to enter the competition. If you're new, we hope you'll use this oppurtunity to practice a new tool.  If you're an expert, we hope you'll share the knowledge and document interesting ways to approach this problem.

## Dataset Description

This is a synthetic data set of 40 features, representing objects from two classes (labeled as 0 or 1). The training set has 1000 samples and the testing set has 9000.
